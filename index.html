&quot;Bath-In-A-Field.Co.uk&quot; (it was called Bath-In-A-Field.com, but it was
toooo expensive for a skint bloke like me to keep...). This web site was created to give the world the
opportunity to share in my pleasure of &quot;Tub-Spotting&quot;. We all know the feeling.
It's a wet autumn day, and your forced into the back seat of your fathers green Hillman
hunter, and driven around the countryside. Your fed-up! Then . . . something catches your
eye in the field to the left of you. &quot;<font SIZE="4"><u><b>CHRIST</b></u></font>&quot;
you shout at the top of your voice as your father slams on the breaks. You race out of the
car and stop just a few yards away from it. You know that this is one of those times that
will change your world forever.</p>

<p>CHRIST, We've only gone and made it on the radio!&nbsp; That nice bloke &quot;Steve
Wright&quot; give the site a plug (cheap bath humour....) on Radio 2 on the 26th July
2001. Your favourite bath spotting page was also on the Radio 2 website <a
href="RADIO2.JPG">here</a>.</p>

<p>And since then, the world has gone mad, with over 1000 visitors looking at the
porcelain tubs&nbsp; in just a few days. And so my fellow tub spotters I give you the
following pictures sent in by other &quot;tub Spotters&quot; :-) Please send in your local
tub pictures to <a href="mailto:webmaster@tredegar.co.uk">here</a>.</p>
